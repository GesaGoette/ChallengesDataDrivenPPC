# Supplementary Material for "Production Planning and Control in Industry 4.0: Overview on Challenges of Data-Driven PPC Systems"

This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper *"Production Planning and Control in Industry 4.0: Overview on Challenges of Data-Driven PPC Systems"*. The paper discusses 30 distinct challenges in adopting data-driven Production Planning and Control (PPC) systems in Industry 4.0. These challenges are categorized into entry barriers, data-related issues, complexity of PPC tasks, and operational constraints.

The materials provided here offer a comprehensive view of the challenges identified in the literature, along with a timeline of the reviewed papers. We welcome future collaboration with researchers, practitioners, and industry professionals to refine and assess the relevance of these challenges from an industrial perspective.
